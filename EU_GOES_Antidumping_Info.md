## Duty Structure

### Minimum Import Price (MIP) System

⚠️ **Important:** This measure uses a **Minimum Import Price (MIP)** system instead of traditional ad valorem dumping duties.

Under the MIP system:
- Duties are applied when imports enter the EU below specified minimum prices
- Three different MIPs apply to three product categories based on core loss and thickness
- Individual company dumping margins are **not** specified
- The system provides flexibility while protecting EU industry

**Key Features:**
1. **Variable Duties:** Calculated based on the difference between the import price and the MIP
2. **Product Categories:** Three categories with different MIPs
3. **Certification Required:** Importers must provide mill certificates and commercial invoices

---

## Companies Affected

**Number of Companies with Individual Rates:** 0

**Note:** Under the MIP system, individual company dumping margins are not calculated. Instead, all imports from the target countries are subject to the MIP requirements regardless of the specific producer or exporter.
